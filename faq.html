  <dl>
    <dt>Are you serious?</dt>
    <dd>Yes.</dd>
    <dt>How cool are dragons?</dt>
    <dd>They're very cool - unless you're right in front of them - then they get VERY hot.</dd>	
    <dt>But... dragons...</dt>
    <dd>Look, they're cool - and they came with the site I used as a template... don't judge me.</dd>	
    <dt>Why does this exist?</dt>
    <dd>This site has been built as a simple hearing aid - the code uses pizzicato.js and is built on a template borrowed from  <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/">Google Codelabs</a>.</dd>
    <dt>Where are the images from?</dt>
    <dd>The logo is from <a href="https://maps.googleblog.com/2012/03/begin-your-quest-with-google-maps-8-bit.html">Google Maps 8-bit</a>, some assets from <a href="https://openclipart.org/detail/190725/chinese-zodiac-dragon">openclipart</a>, other assets were built for the site from <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/">Google Codelabs</a> that is used here as a template.</dd>
